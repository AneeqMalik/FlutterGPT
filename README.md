# ChatGPT Flutter App using OpenAI API Key
Welcome to the ChatGPT Flutter app created using the OpenAI API key. This app allows users to chat with a large language model known as ChatGPT, which has been trained by OpenAI. With ChatGPT, users can ask questions, have conversations, and get intelligent responses based on the language model's training data.

# How to Use
To use this app, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Set up an OpenAI API key by creating an account at OpenAI.
3. Replace YOUR_API_KEY with your OpenAI API key:
4. Install the required dependencies by running flutter pub get in the terminal.
5. Run the app by running flutter run in the terminal.

The app should launch on your emulator or connected device.
Once the app is running, users can start chatting with ChatGPT by typing in the input box and hitting send. ChatGPT will respond with a message based on its training data.
