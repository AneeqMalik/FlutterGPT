# ChatGPT Flutter App using OpenAI API Key
Welcome to the ChatGPT Flutter app created using the OpenAI API key. This app allows users to chat with a large language model known as ChatGPT, which has been trained by OpenAI. With ChatGPT, users can ask questions, have conversations, and get intelligent responses based on the language model's training data.
